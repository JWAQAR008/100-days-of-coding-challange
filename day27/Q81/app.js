// Question 81: Iterating Over Object Properties: Write a function that takes an object as an argument and logs all of its properties and values.
// Explain & TIP: You can loop through each property of an object using a for...in loop. 
// This is useful for when you need to examine or display all the information an object holds.
// This function shows every detail about an object
function logObjectProperties(obj) {
    for (var property in obj) {
        // Loops through each property in the object
        console.log("".concat(property, ": ").concat(obj[property]));
        // Shows the property name and its value
    }
}
// Using the function with a car object
logObjectProperties({ make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2021, color: "blue" });
// It tells us each piece of information stored about the car.
