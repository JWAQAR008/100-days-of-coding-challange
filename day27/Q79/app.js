// Question 79: Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing a car with properties for make, model, and year.
//  Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.
// Explain & TIP: Objects are collections of properties, kind of like a box for storing related information.
//  You can create an object to group related data and access its properties using either dot notation or bracket notation.
// This sets up an object for a car with specific details
var car = {
    make: "Toyota",
    model: "Grande 1.8",
    year: "2024"
};
// Accessing and showing the car's model
console.log(car.model);
